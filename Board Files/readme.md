# Board Files
Only images and schematics at this stage.

Gerbers will be added after final prototypes have been tested.
PCBA files will be in JLCPCB format.

Most connectors have been omitted from board images for clarity.

## Bill of Materials
The Consolidated BOM file contains counts of:
- Connectors for a Main Board with PCBA of all SMD components
- SMD Components for the optional -5V supply on the Main Board
- Connectors and components (all through hole) for BARE Wing Boards
